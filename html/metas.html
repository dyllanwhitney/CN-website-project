    <h1 class="center">meta's in overwatch</h1>
    
    <p> now ket's talk about metas in overwatch,theres bin a few different 
        metas in overwatch over the years, one of my favourites being
        dive meta that consisted of winston, (a gorilla with a tesla gun and a protective shield)
        diva, (a 18 year old gamer ina robo suit that has a defense matrix and rockets attached to the suit)
        genji(a ninja with a dash ability and deflect that throws shurikens and has a 
        dragonblade for his ultimate) and tracer (a 18 year old girl with the ability to
        blink in  and out of danger with the help of her core on the strap around her body)
        the healer's lucio, (a jamaican DJ on skates with a AOE heal and a AOE speedboost 
        his ultimate being drop the beat which gives you 1000 effective hp)
        and the other healer doesnt matter as much but a dive comp is built for communication 
        at it's highest form and is very effective but hard to pull of.

    theres bin other metas such as rush meta which had reinhardt, zarya, 
    baptiste, lucio, doomfist, reaper, which are all characters 
    that can rush and secure an elimination fast with the help of lucio's 
    speed AMP.
    this meta was like a spear with reinhardt being the tip of it and reaper and doomfist 
    following being with the supports and zarya who can bubble herself and 
    a teamate to gain charge (extra damage) to essentially overpower the 
    enemy team quicker.

    and i will mention 1 more meta but its certainly not the least powerful meta. 
    im talking about the infamous goats meta which was only available in open Queue
    where you can pick any hero despite the role they are placed in.
    the goats meta consisted of three tanks and three healer and 
    the goal was to dive one target that is out of position as a team and 
    one shot them which was hard to stop and dominate the community for years until the 
    release of role Queue which meant you can only pick two dps, two tanks and two healer's 
    which meant you had to pick your role instead of just Queue for another game.

    i hope this website has provided you the information you needed to know.
